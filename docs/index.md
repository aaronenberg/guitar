## Music Theory

### Diatonic Scale

A diatonic scale is a heptatonic (seven-note) scale that includes five whole
steps (whole tones) and two half steps (semitones) in each octave, in which the
two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps.
In other words, the half steps are maximally separated from each other.

In Western music, there are seven such scales, and they are commonly known as
the modes of the major scale: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian,
Aeolian, and Locrian.
